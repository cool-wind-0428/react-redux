## Description

React application bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for using with `REST API` and [Redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux) for state managing.

Both components and redux-specific code (reducers, actions, action types) splitted by feature-first pattern [Re-Ducks](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/scaling-your-redux-app-with-ducks-6115955638be).

Please enjoy yourself.
